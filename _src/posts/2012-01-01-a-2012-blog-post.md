Here is an example blog post.

如果蔡果真在本週末後當選總統，我覺得她該認真想想的人物是重慶時代的蔣介石。若民進黨重新執政，必定面對北京的步步進逼。形式相近的威逼，抗戰時期的蔣介石都以更慘烈的方式面對過。

<span lang="ja">語源は、イタリア語のペペローネ peperone の複数形ペペローニ peperoni である。イタリア語のペペローネ（ペペローニ）は唐辛子やピーマンのことだが、ペパロニはそれをスパイスとして使ったサラミを意味するようになった。</span>

Everything after this paragraph "after the break". On index pages and
Atom feeds, it will become "Continue reading...", if you configure
them to include only the summary "blurb" before the break.

## Code blocks

Frog optionally uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) if it's
installed to do syntax highlighting. In your markdown using backtick
code blocks you can specify a language:

    ```language
    some racket code
    ```

That name is given to Pygments as the lexer to use.

For example this:

    ```js
    /**
     * Some JavaScript
     */
    function foo()
    {
        if (counter <= 10)
            return;
        // it works!
    ```

Yields this:

```js
/**
 * Some JavaScript
 */
function foo()
{
    if (counter <= 10)
        return;
    // it works!
```

And this:

    ```racket
    #lang racket
    ;; Finds Racket sources in all subdirs
    (for ([path (in-directory)])
      (when (regexp-match? #rx"[.]rkt$" path)
        (printf "source file: ~a\n" path)))
    (symbol->string 'foo)
    ```

Yields this:

```racket
#lang racket
;; Finds Racket sources in all subdirs
(for ([path (in-directory)])
  (when (regexp-match? #rx"[.]rkt$" path)
    (printf "source file: ~a\n" path)))
(symbol->string 'foo)
```

Notice that, for Racket, symbols with unambiguous documentation
(provided by one library, or provided by several where one is `racket`
or `racket/base`) are links to that documentation.

This also works outside fenced code blocks, for symbols in backticks
immediately followed by `[racket]`. Example: `printf`[racket]. This
isn't official Markdown; it's simply a pun on link syntax and fenced
code block languages. This is similar to using `@racket[printf]` in
Scribble.

`symbol->string`[racket].

Here is a lambda: λ.

Here is a lambda in code backticks: `λ`.

And here in indented code block:

    (λ () #t)

And here in fenced code block, no lang specified:

```
(λ () #t)
```

And here in fenced code block, lang = `racket`:

```racket
(λ () #t)
```

And here in fenced code block, lang = `scheme`:

```scheme
(λ () #t)
```

Here's a simple `for` macro, written in [Racket][define-syntax-rule]:

```racket
(define-syntax-rule (for (x e1) e2)
  (for-each (λ (x) e2) e1))
```

The end.
